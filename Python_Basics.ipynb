        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "    \n",
        "  Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity. It is popular due to its clean syntax, large standard library, vast community support, and wide range of applications—from web development to data science and automation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   An interpreter in Python reads and executes the code line by line,     translating Python code into machine-readable instructions at runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   Pre-defined keywords are reserved words in Python that have special meanings and cannot be used for variable names (e.g., if, while, for, True, None, class).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "\n",
        "   No, keywords cannot be used as variable names because they are reserved for special syntax or functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   Mutability refers to an object’s ability to be changed after it is created. Mutable objects can be altered (e.g., lists), while immutable objects cannot (e.g., tuples, strings).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Lists are designed to hold dynamic data that may change, so they allow modifications. Tuples are intended for fixed data collections, providing safety from changes, which is why they are immutable.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between == and is operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    == checks value equality (do the values match?).\n",
        "\n",
        "    is checks identity (are both references pointing to the same object in memory?).\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:\n",
        "\n",
        "    and: True if both conditions are true\n",
        "\n",
        "    or: True if at least one condition is true\n",
        "\n",
        "    not: Inverts the truth value\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Type casting is converting one data type into another (e.g., converting a string to an integer using int(\"5\")).\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Implicit: Done automatically by Python (e.g., int + float → float)\n",
        "\n",
        "    Explicit: Manually done using functions like int(), float(), str() by the programmer.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Conditional statements (like if, elif, else) allow a program to make decisions and execute specific code blocks based on whether a condition is true.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "\n",
        "    elif (else if) provides additional conditions to check after an if condition. If the if is false, Python checks each elif in order until one is true or falls to else.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "\n",
        "    for loop: Used when you know the number of iterations (e.g., iterating over a list).\n",
        "\n",
        "    while loop: Used when the number of iterations is not known and depends on a condition being true.\n",
        "    \n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "    When waiting for user input until it’s valid:\n",
        "\n",
        "while True:\n",
        "    password = input(\"Enter password: \")\n",
        "    if password == \"1234\":\n",
        "        break\n",
        "Here, we don’t know how many times the loop will run, so while is more appropriate.\n",
