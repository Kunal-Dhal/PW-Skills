    "**Answer:**\n",
    "A random variable is a numerical value associated with the outcome of a random experiment.\n",
    "**Explanation:** For example, if you flip a coin, you can define a random variable X that assigns 1 for heads and 0 for tails. It helps us quantify randomness."

    "- Discrete random variables (countable outcomes like 1, 2, 3).\n",
    "- Continuous random variables (uncountable outcomes like time, weight, or height).\n",
